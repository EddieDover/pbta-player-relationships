# PbtA Player Relationships

A Foundry VTT module that adds a player relationships system to PbtA characters. This module allows GMs to roll for relationships between player characters and track them directly on character sheets.

## Features

- **Relationship Rolling**: GMs can roll for relationships between player characters using a two-tier dice system (1d8 for category, 1d10 for specific relationship)
- **Relationships Tab**: Adds a dedicated "Relationships" tab to PbtA character sheets
- **8 Relationship Categories**: Companions, Professional, Romantic, Obligation & Debt, Shared Secrets, History, Conflict, and Family & Kin
- **80 Unique Relationships**: 10 specific relationships per category.
- **Custom Relationships**: Don't like the built-in relationships? Edit them and write your own!
- **Custom Nested RollTable Support**: Supports using your own nested-rolltables for relationships.
- **Relationship Map Viewer**: A button in the token section allows you to view a relationship web.

## Usage

### For GMs

**Rolling Individual Relationships:**

1. Open a player character sheet
2. Navigate to the "Relationships" tab
3. Click the button next to another player character's name
4. The relationship will be rolled and posted to chat, then stored on the character sheet

#### Custom Roll Tables

To create a set of roll-tables refer to the [Foundry VTT Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/article/roll-tables/#nesting).

1. Create a rollable table for each category you want such as "Positive", "Negative", or "Rivals"
2. Within that table, create new items for each of the outcomes. For instance, if they are close, this might be "One reminds the other of a lost friend or family member." or "They both witnessed something they shouldn't have."
   1. Each of these items should have a description of the relationship. Try to keep this a short descriptive sentence.
   2. If no description is set, the name of the item is used.
3. Once you have all of your relationship tables built, create one more rollable table to link them together. Drag the tables you have created into the list of this primary table.
   1. Make sure to edit the `Roll Formula` in the `Summary` tab, to match the amount of sub-tables you have created. _If you have 6 sub-tables, it should list the roll as 1d6, etc._
4. Open your settings, and change the custom table dropdown for `pbta-player-relationships` to use your newly created custom table.

### For Players

Players can view their character's relationships on the "Relationships" tab of their character sheet. Only GMs can roll for new relationships.
